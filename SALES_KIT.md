# 💰 Sales Kit - Voice to Text

Your complete guide to selling Voice to Text to friends and colleagues.

## 🎯 Quick Sales Process

### The 3-Step System

```
1. Demo → 2. QR Code → 3. Install Command
```

That's it! Keep it simple.

## 📱 Step 1: The Demo

### What to Show

1. **Show the menu bar icon** - "See this mic? That's the whole app"
2. **Open a text field** (Messages, email, Notes)
3. **Press Control + Space** - "Watch this..."
4. **Speak naturally** - Say something impressive (see scripts below)
5. **Press Control + Space** - Stop recording
6. **Wait 2-3 seconds** - Text appears magically!
7. **Repeat** - Do it again to show it's not a trick

### Demo Scripts (What to Say)

**For Students:**
> "Hey, what's your name? Cool, let me show you something. *[Open Messages/Notes]* Watch - I'm not touching the keyboard... *[Press Control+Space]* 'This essay is about the impact of artificial intelligence on modern education and how students can leverage technology to improve their learning outcomes' *[Press Control+Space, text appears]* That just saved me like 30 seconds of typing. Works everywhere - essays, notes, emails, everything."

**For Professionals:**
> "Dude, check this out. *[Opens email]* Control Space... *[Speaks]* 'Hi team, following up on today's meeting. The project timeline looks good and we should be able to deliver by Friday. Let me know if you need anything else.' *[Text appears]* Boom. Email done in 5 seconds. I use this for like 50 emails a day."

**For Bilingual Friends:**
> "Bro, this is wild. *[Opens text]* Listen... *[Speaks in Spanish]* 'Hola, ¿cómo estás? Necesito hablar contigo sobre el proyecto.' *[Switches output language to English]* Now watch - same thing in English *[Text appears in English]* See? Instant translation while you type."

### The Hook

After the demo, say one of these:

- "Yeah, it's been a game-changer. I barely type anymore."
- "I know right? It's like having a personal assistant."
- "Honestly, I don't know how I worked without this."

**Then pause.** Let them ask about it.

## 💳 Step 2: Payment Request

### When They Ask "How Much?"

**Option A (Direct):**
> "It's [YOUR PRICE]. One-time payment, use it forever. Want it?"

**Option B (Value-First):**
> "So the commercial version of this is like $15-30/month. This is a one-time [YOUR PRICE] and you own it forever. Plus it's faster and runs on your Mac, not the cloud."

**Option C (Casual):**
> "Just [YOUR PRICE]. Way cheaper than those subscription tools. Venmo/Zelle me and I'll send you the install link."

### Suggested Pricing

- **Friends/Students:** $15-25
- **Professionals:** $30-50
- **Businesses:** $75-100

*Tip: Price based on value to THEM, not cost to you.*

### Send Payment QR Code

**Message Template:**
```
Cool! Here's my [Venmo/Zelle/PayPal]:

[YOUR QR CODE IMAGE]

Or: @YourUsername

Just send $XX and I'll shoot you the setup link right after. Takes like 5 min to install, super easy.
```

## 📨 Step 3: Post-Payment Delivery

### What to Send (Copy/Paste)

Once you see payment, send this:

```

### 30-Second Script

1. **Show menu bar** (0:00-0:03)
   - "This mic icon = Voice to Text"

2. **Open text field** (0:03-0:05)
   - Open Messages or Notes

3. **Press Control Space** (0:05-0:07)
   - Show the icon turn red

4. **Speak clearly** (0:07-0:15)
   - "This is an example of voice to text. I'm speaking naturally and it's converting everything I say into text instantly."

5. **Stop recording** (0:15-0:17)
   - Press Control Space again

6. **Show result** (0:17-0:20)
   - Text appears perfectly formatted

7. **Text overlay** (0:20-0:30)
   - "3x faster than typing"
   - "Works everywhere"
   - "DM for access"

### Recording Tips
- Record in QuickTime or screen recorder
- Good lighting, clean audio
- Show your hands on keyboard (proves you're not typing)
- Keep it under 30 seconds
- Add captions if possible

## 🤝 Handling Objections

### "I don't need this"
> "Fair! Though... how many messages/emails do you send per day? Even if it saves you 30 seconds each... that's like an hour a week. Up to you though!"

### "Seems expensive"
> "I get it. But compare it to [competitor] - that's $20/month = $240/year. This is a one-time [price] and you own it forever. Plus no subscriptions to remember."

### "Can't I just use Siri?"
> "Haha yeah technically... but this is way faster, works in ALL apps (not just Apple's), and you don't have to say 'Hey Siri' every time. Plus it has way better accuracy for tech stuff and supports Spanish perfectly."

### "Is this legal?"
> "100%. It's open-source AI (Whisper) running on YOUR Mac. Nothing shady, no cloud stuff, totally private. Like having your own personal transcription tool."

### "What if I don't like it?"
> "Tell you what - try it for a week. If you hate it, I'll refund you. But honestly, once you use it, you won't want to go back to typing."

## 📊 Tracking Sales

### Simple System

Create a text file or note:

```
[Date] [Name] [Amount] [Status]
------------------------
10/27 John   $25      Paid + Sent
10/27 Sarah  $25      Interested
10/28 Mike   $30      Paid + Sent
```

## 💡 Upsell Opportunities

Once they're hooked:

1. **Refer friends**: "Get $10 off for each friend who buys"
2. **Update packages**: "New features coming - $5 for future updates"
3. **Support plans**: "Priority support for $5/month"
4. **Custom features**: "$50 for custom hotkey/languages"

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Do's:
✅ Demo in person when possible (or FaceTime/Zoom)
✅ Let them try it on YOUR Mac
✅ Be casual and authentic
✅ Follow up if they seem interested
✅ Offer help with setup

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't oversell - keep it simple
❌ Don't be pushy - it's a cool tool, not a life change
❌ Don't ghost after payment - provide support
❌ Don't share install link publicly - only with paying customers
❌ Don't promise features that don't exist

## 🚀 Scaling Up

### When You Have 10+ Sales:

1. **Automate payment confirmations** (Zapier + Venmo/PayPal)
2. **Create a simple landing page** (Carrd, Notion, etc.)
3. **Set up email auto-responses** with install instructions
4. **Build a referral program** (spreadsheet tracking is fine)
5. **Collect testimonials** from happy customers

### When You Have 50+ Sales:

1. **Consider proper e-commerce** (Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy)
2. **Build a support FAQ** page
3. **Create tutorial videos** for YouTube
4. **Set up a Discord/Slack** for customers
5. **Hire someone to handle support** (if needed)

## 📈 Increasing Prices

As you get more customers:
- First 10 people: $15-20
- Next 20 people: $25-30
- After that: $35-40
- Premium features: $50+

**Scarcity messaging**: "Early adopter price - only 5 spots left at $20"

## 🎯 Target Audiences

### Easy Sales:
- College students (essays, notes)
- Bilingual friends (Spanish support)
- Remote workers (emails, Slack)
- Content creators (scripts, captions)
- Your coworkers (if office allows)

### Harder Sales (but higher prices):
- Lawyers (dictation billable at $$$)
- Doctors (medical notes)
- Writers/journalists (articles)
- Small business owners (communications)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Track these:
- **Demo-to-sale ratio** (% who buy after demo)
- **Average sale price**
- **Refund rate** (should be 0-5%)
- **Referrals per customer** (word of mouth)
- **Setup success rate** (% who complete install)

**Good luck! You've got a killer product. Now go make some money! 💰**

Remember: You're not selling software. You're selling the gift of time.
